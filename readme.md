# RealityFlow
Content creation tool designed to enable rapid experimental content creation and user
testing for XR. Includes real-time collaboration and streamlined interaction/content
design patterns.

The first version (built in 2019) enabled real-time synchronized editing of Unity
objects across multiple platforms, including HoloLens, Mobile phones, Web and Unity.

The primary objective for the next version (2020) is to enable authoring XR-specific
interactions and manage state, including features included in VRTK and ARCore.

Features on the roadmap include recording analytics data.
